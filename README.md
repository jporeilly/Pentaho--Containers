## <font color='red'> Pentaho-Containers 9.3</font>
As part of customers cloud journey many of the services used and connected as part of defined ETL workflows are present and managed by the cloud (such as storage buckets, relational & analytical databases, messaging systems, etc.).
It means Pentaho is required to:
* Sit close to these services for security and performance considerations
* Ability to scale up and down based on requirements
* In short, adjust to the deployment pattern used as standard in the enterprise
Hitachi Vantara doesnâ€™t provide an out of the box container image mainly because we believe that each customer and each deployment has specific needs. Our approach is to provide this workshop as a guide for your very specific Pentaho on Kubernetes journey.
